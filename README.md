## Click on a ball to reveal its secret!

### Description:
This is a little hide-and-seek game with GPS coordinates.

When you click on a ball, it will show you a hidden message.
Some balls reveal nothing special, while others contain clues—indexes you'll need to calculate the final coordinates where the geocache is hidden.

### How to Play:
Try clicking on any ball. If you hit it, you'll see what it’s hiding.
The message will be revealed for only 0.5 seconds.

### Objective:
Reveal all the necessary clues.
